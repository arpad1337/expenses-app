In the `input.json` you can see a list of Tom's expenses.
Going through the list manually takes a lot of time for him, but he wants to see how much he spends in each category,
and on what he spends the most.
Help Tom by creating an expense tracker application.

Group the expenses by categories, and sort them by the amount he spent (in descending order). If there are categories with the same amount,
order them by expenses count (in descending order).

As you will see the data includes different currencies. Make life easier for him, and convert EUR and GBP to USD.
The exchange rates are:
EUR -> USD (1.1)
GBP -> USD (1.3)

Follow the design, and create an accordion with a headline, which should include the category, the number of expenses,
and the sum of the items in the category.
Tom should be able to see what expenses are in a category in descending order by date.

**Nice to have:**
- He wants to pay attention to certain areas of his expenses, and he would like to mark those as favorites. Those should be pinned on
the top of the list.
- Make sure if Tom hits refresh, he won't lose his favorites.
- Tests

You can use any kind of framework you like.
